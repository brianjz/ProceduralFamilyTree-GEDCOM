# Procedural Family Tree to GEDCOM

Uses the [Procedural Family Tree](https://github.com/brianjz/ProceduralFamilyTree) and [Gene Genie GEDCOM](https://github.com/TheGeneGenieProject/GeneGenie.Gedcom) projects to make a procedurally-generated family tree and output it to a GEDCOM.

Currently makes a validated GEDCOM, but it does not convert correctly into RootsMagic since it doesn't seem to support the CHAN tags that Gene Genie writes.
